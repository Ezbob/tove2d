Animated vector graphics for [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

## Description
TÖVE is a vector drawing canvas for LÖVE, think HTML5's `<canvas>` or  Haxe's `Graphics`. Which you can animate. Efficiently.

## Features
* brings crisp vector graphics and SVGs to LÖVE
* built for for real-time animation of forms and colors
* configurable renderers, including a unique GPU renderer
* uses OpenGL ES 
* less than 512K in binary size

## Status
TÖVE is experimental and alpha. Things are missing, things might change.

Do not expect TÖVE to produce print quality vector renderings. It's a simplified vector graphics library for games, and it has its limits. For example, support for line dashes and line caps is patchy.

## Getting Started
I've written up the essential stuff in these four sections:

* Getting Started
* The Demos
* Setting Renderers
* Animating Things

## License
TÖVE is licensed under the MIT license.

Details and the licenses of the included third party code are found in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/poke1024/tove2d/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Credits
TÖVE owes a lot to Mikko Mononen's excellent NanoSVG. Not only does TÖVE call NanoSVG in various places, it has also inherited some of its code.

TÖVE's API was inspired by [EaselJS](https://www.createjs.com/easeljs) and [PlotDevice](https://plotdevice.io/PlotDevice).

The rabbit you see in the tutorials and demos is from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/). The font in the demos is "amatic" by Vernon Adams.

## About the name
TÖVE is a portmanteau of **LÖVE**, **To**wards **Ve**ctor Graphics and **Tove** Jansson, the Swedish author and illustrator of the Moomins.
